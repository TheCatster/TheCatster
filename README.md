### **I do not develop anything on GitHub anymore!** 
All projects are developed on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~thecatster/), and are simply mirrored here (although some projects are exclusively on Sourcehut). Look for my work there!

This account is kept to contribute to projects that are on GitHub (and stuff like game jams) and for work.

### For a bit more detail... 

```rust
let danielRose = Engineer {
  main_languages: ["Rust", "C", "Python", "Clojure"],
  hobby_languages: ["Lisp/Scheme (Emacs Hy Common Chicken)", "JVM (Kotlin Scala)"],
  tools: ["Docker", "SQL", "Tensorflow", "Nginx", "Pandas", "rppal"],
  work: ["Writing performance-critical embedded applications in Rust"],
};
```
